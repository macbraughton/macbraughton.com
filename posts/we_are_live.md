After some issues with the setting the DNS records, I was able to get the blog live on [macbraughton.com](https://macbraughton.com).

The source code lives on [Github](https://github.com/macbraughton/macbraughton.com) and is deployed for free on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

The only trouble I had was with the acme challenge for setting up a Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate. DNS records are very precise and far from intuitive. I forgot to add the trailing period after the deno.dev hostname in the CNAME record.

All is good now.

Looking forward to now having a place to go to share my thoughts and ideas on the projects I'm working on, as well as more general stuff about software and business development.

Oh yeah, let's go!
