Well, for me at least.

I've been planning to restart this blog for a long, long time.

What's stopped me?

Well, there always seems to be something a little more pressing. And I tend to get hung up thinking about things like the technology and the platform I'm gonna use to build it.

And then when I have chosen what tech I'm gonna use I start fussing over details of what everything is going to look like. Gotta have the perfect layout!

Somehow I never seem to get to the point where I actually choose something and start writing.

Well, that changes today!

After reading the article this morning on [dev.to](https://dev.to), [Fresh: The Next-Gen JavaScript Web Framework](https://dev.to/harshhhdev/fresh-the-next-gen-javascript-web-framework-b39), it got me thinking about [Deno](https://deno.land) which led me to Ryan Dahl's blog [tinyclouds.org](https://tinyclouds.org).

It is a bit of an understatement to say that Ryan is a really important person in the Web development community and someone who I've learned so much from over the years.

Anyway, this blog will use the same software that he's using: [Deno Blog](https://deno.land/x/blog@0.3.3).

I'll spend some time customizing the layout (eventually), but mainly I'll try to not get distracted too much on those parts.

That's all because the real work I need to focus on, and the real messages that I want to get out there, has very little to do with my personal blog and everything to do with what I'm building over at [Hyxos](https://hyxos.io).

Fresh sounds cool, but so far, Hyxos is built in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

This blog can be a way for me to learn more about Deno, as well as document that project.

Anway, time to deploy with [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy)! From what I've experienced with Deno so far I'm quite impressed... going from knowing nothing to deploying a blog in an afternoon is pretty sweet.
